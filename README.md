The code in folder ProjectA is used to solve the problems in Project A.
projectA_writeup.pdf provides the answers to the questions that cannot
be answered by the code itself.

Ignore folder ProjectB, I was unable to finish Project B. The answer to question
1 of Project B can be found in the file projectB_writeup.pdf.
